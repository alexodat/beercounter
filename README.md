# beercounter
school Project

Hey there, 

I'm a student, unexperienced when it comes to coding and I have a school project to do #SOS. So I'm just trying to code this android app which is a beer counter, that would tell the user if he/she is able to drive back home safe or not. The user would only have to hit the button "I'm taking a beer" every times he/she takes one in order to start a new loop (calculous with his/her weight, age, time and type of beer). 

Well, cheerz folks.
